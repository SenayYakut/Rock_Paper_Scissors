# Rock_Paper_Scissors

Rock Paper or Scissors is a JavaScript project.

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

Rock destroys scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
Our code will break the game into four parts:

Get the user’s choice.
Get the computer’s choice.
Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
Start the program and display the results.
